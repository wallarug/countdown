# countdown
A Countdown Timer for offline use.


## Usage

The timer settings are located on the "settings" tab for adding in hours, minutes, seconds.  Included in a raw text input area that has magic built in.

If you use a ";" symbol on its own line, you can add multiple subjects.  The benefits of this is that the font size is dynamic to the number of subjects and details that you put in.
